* PROBLEM
You are given two lists of closed intervals, =firstList= and =secondList=, where =firstList[i] = [starti, endi]= and =secondList[j] = [startj, endj]=. Each list of intervals is pairwise disjoint and in sorted order.

Return the intersection of these two interval lists.

A closed interval =[a, b]= (with =a<=b=) denotes the set of real numbers =x= with =a<=x<=b=.

The intersection of two closed intervals is a set of real numbers that are either empty or represented as a closed interval. For example, the intersection of =[1, 3]= and =[2, 4]= is =[2, 3]=.

#+begin_src org
*Input*: firstList = [[0,2],[5,10],[13,23],[24,25]], secondList = [[1,5],[8,12],[15,24],[25,26]]
*Output*: [[1,2],[5,5],[8,10],[15,23],[24,24],[25,25]]

** Example 2
#+begin_src org
*Input*: firstList = [[1,3],[5,9]], secondList = []
*Output*: []
#+end_src

* SOLVING
We'll use Two Pointer method to solve this problem.

** Steps
1. Create the variable =result=
2. Place =LeftPtr= to first list in =firstList= and =RightPtr= to first list in =secondList=
3. While =LeftPtr= and =RightPtr= aren't superior of =firstList= and =rightList= size:
   1. =Start= value of the =intersectedList= equal =max= between first element of =LeftPtr= and =RightPtr=
   2. =End= value of the =intersectedList= equal =min= between last element of =LeftPtr= and =RightPtr=
   3. If =Start= is inferior or equal to =End= you can push your =intersectedList= to =result=
   4. if =End= equal to =LeftPtr= last element, increase =LeftPtr= otherwise =RightPtr=
4. Return =result=

** Code
#+begin_src cpp
class Solution {
public:
  vector<vector<int>> intervalIntersection(vector<vector<int>> &firstList,
                                           vector<vector<int>> &secondList) {
    vector<vector<int>> result;
    int leftPtr = 0;
    int rightPtr = 0;

    while (leftPtr < firstList.size() && rightPtr < secondList.size()) {
      vector<int> intersectedList;
      int start = max(firstList[leftPtr][0], secondList[rightPtr][0]);
      int end = min(firstList[leftPtr][1], secondList[rightPtr][1]);

      if (start <= end) result.push_back({start, end});
      (end == firstList[leftPtr][1]) ? leftPtr++ : rightPtr++;
    }
    return result;
  }
};
