* PROBLEM
Given a text file =file.txt= that contains a list of phone numbers (one per line), write a one-liner bash script to print all valid phone numbers.

You may assume that a valid phone number must appear in one of the following two formats: (xxx) xxx-xxxx or xxx-xxx-xxxx. (x means a digit)

You may also assume each line in the text file must not contain leading or trailing white spaces.

** Example:
Assume that =file.txt= has the following content:
#+begin_src txt
987-123-4567
123 456 7890
(123) 456-7890
#+end_src

Your script should output the following valid phone numbers:
#+begin_src txt
987-123-4567
(123) 456-7890
#+end_src

* SOLVING
We'll use Regex to solve this problem

** Steps
+ Just use a Regex to check your file, /^(\([0-9]{3}\)\s|[0-9]{3}-)[0-9]{3}-[0-9]{4}$/

** Code
#+begin_src shell
grep -E "^(\([0-9]{3}\)\s|[0-9]{3}-)[0-9]{3}-[0-9]{4}$" file.txt
#+end_src
